OpenFM OBS Plugin – Manual Installation (Windows)
=================================================

Derived from BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md – “Manual Installation” section.

Prerequisites
-------------
1. OBS Studio 31.0+ must already be installed.
2. Close OBS before copying files.

Install Steps
-------------
1. Plugin DLL
   Copy `openfm.dll` into:
   `%APPDATA%\obs-studio\obs-plugins\64bit\`
   (Create the directory if it does not exist.)

2. Data files (optional)
   If future builds include data assets, copy them into:
   `%APPDATA%\obs-studio\data\obs-plugins\openfm\`
   (Current build does not ship extra data files, so this step can be skipped.)

3. Restart OBS Studio.
   After launch, open *View → Docks → OpenFM* and ensure the dock loads the local UI
   (http://127.0.0.1:6767 by default).

Uninstall
---------
Delete `openfm.dll` from the plugin directory listed above and restart OBS.
